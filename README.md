# To-Do list

Built as part of School of Code to practise testing and TDD/red-green refactoring

### Requirements:

- Use useReducer
- Design the reducer function using test-driven development

### MVP user stories:

- I want to add todos to the list.
- I want to see list of todos added so far.
- I want to mark todos as complete one by one.
- I want to delete todos.

### Stretch goals:

- I want to be able to prioritize todos.
- I want to set deadlines for tasks.
- I want to have a way to set reminder alerts.

## To run test build:

- npm start (as it's built with Create-React-App)
